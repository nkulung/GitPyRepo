# GitPyRepo
Displays selected users GitHub Repositories

GitPyRepo asks for a Github username and returns and lists all their repositories along with a reachable link to each repository.

urllib3
requests

This was made without using GitHub's api but rather just extracting then parsing the HTML for each user.
